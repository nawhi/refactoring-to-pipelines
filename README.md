# Collection Pipeline Refactoring Exercises

Learn how to express algorithms using collection pipelines instead of loops.

This is a TypeScript version of [Duncan McGregor](https://github.com/dmcg)'s [refactoring-to-streams](https://github.com/dmcg/refactoring-to-streams), designed to teach Java 8 Streams.

For an introduction to the topic, see [Refactoring with Loops and Collection Pipelines](http://martinfowler.com/articles/refactoring-pipelines.html) by Martin Fowler.

## Instructions

To get started, clone the repository and run `yarn install`.

For each exercise, the task is to use your functional / collections pipeline library of choice to refactor the function marked `refactor me`. 

At a minimum you should be able to remove the for-loop. Depending on which library you use, it may be possible to make it look considerably neater.

Some libraries that might be useful include lodash and ramdajs; but which one you use is up to you.

Good luck!
